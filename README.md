## Feasiblity step
This is a script to run to get the Feasibility counts for the MegaStudy.
You should just interact with the file CodeToRun.R.
Please clone the repository to your local and run all the lines in CodeToRun.R, after adding your own database information.
You should get a .zip file in the folder Results, which you should share.
Thank you for running the feasibiliyt step!
